        <h3>Meet Daisy</h3>
        <p>
          Daisy is a pure white ball of fluff with long, twitching ears and a tiny pink nose that always seems to be sniffing the air. He has soft, velvety fur and big, curious eyes that are a deep, warm brown. Snowball is a very gentle and playful rabbit, though he can also be quite timid, quickly hiding behind the furniture when he's startled. He loves to be petted, especially on his head and back, and his cheeks sometimes move in a soft grinding motion, which I've learned means he's feeling content and happy.
